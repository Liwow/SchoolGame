## Deployment

## Contributing

To contribute, you need to follow the proper workflow and conventions.

### Workflow
#### 1. Create an issue
Before starting anything, an issue **must** be created. This allows for discussion whether it's relevant and how it should be implemented. This can be done if you want to implement something yourself, or just want to something to be implemented.
  1. Create an issue with a short summative title with appropriate tags (at least one is needed).
  2. Start a discussion with fellow peers and contributors.
  3. When a contributor has given affirmation, assign the issue to the one(s) implementing the change.

#### 2. Create a branch
When an issue has been created, discussed and assigned, the assignee can create a new branch. The branch **must** be named
```<most-appropriate-tag>-<issue-number>/<description>``` 

Some examples are:
```
feature-142/notification-system
bug-15/division-by-zero
documentation-244/shader-test
```

#### 3. Create a pull request
After the change has been implemented in the local branch, it should be pushed to the remote branch (with the same name). Thereafter, a pull request **must** be created before merging it to any other branch. This allows for discussion whether it's implemented correctly and follow the conventions.
  1. Create an issue with a short summative title and the line "Fixes #\<issue-number\>" at the first line in the description.
  2. Write what has been changed and how correctness has been confirmed. Also write if something hasn't been cofirmed that could be a potential problem, for example "Didn't test on Windows" or "Didn't check with files over 2 GB".
  3. Start a discussion with fellow peers and contributors.
  4. When a contributor has reviewed and given affirmation, the branch is applicable for merging and deletion.
